# Design Patterns Workshop: Explore Our Solar System

This workshop guides you through a space mission project. Along the way, you'll learn how to build efficient, scalable solutions that support everything from launch operations to
interplanetary communication. By the end, you'll have hands-on experience with 19 design patterns used to solve real-world problems.

## Requirements

1. Intermediate understanding of Java and JUnit/AssertJ
2. JDK 21
3. An IDE of your choice

## Why Learn Design Patterns?

- **Common Vocabulary**: Design patterns provide a standard terminology for specific scenarios
- **Proven Solutions**: They represent solutions that have been refined over time
- **Code Reusability**: They promote reusable designs
- **Anticipate Change**: They help design flexible and maintainable systems

## Getting Started

This workshop will guide you through a series of test classes. The design pattern implementations are located in `src/main/java/patterns`. Each pattern has a corresponding test class in
`src/test/java/tests`. In each test class, you will find an example test demonstrating the pattern, as well as a disabled todo test. Your task is to complete the todo.
Feel free to experiment with the patterns.

You can run the tests in order or jump directly to a specific design pattern you want to explore.
Remember, the goal is to understand the design patterns.
Don’t focus on passing the tests.
The tests are there to guide you through the implementation of the design patterns.

### Patterns

1. **CREATIONAL PATTERNS** 
   - focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexible ways to instantiate objects. They abstract the instantiation process, making it easier to manage
     complex creation logic.
       - [Factory](src/test/java/tests/creational/FactoryTest.java): Centralizes object creation, making it easier to introduce new types without modifying existing code.
       - [Builder](src/test/java/tests/creational/BuilderTest.java): Separates object construction from representation, allowing for more controlled and flexible creation.
       - [Singleton](src/test/java/tests/creational/SingletonTest.java): Ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to it.
       - [Prototype](src/test/java/tests/creational/PrototypeTest.java): Creates object copies without depending on specific classes, reducing repeated initialization code.
2. **STRUCTURAL PATTERNS** 
   - deal with the composition of classes or objects, simplifying the design by identifying reusable structures. They help in
     creating robust and maintainable systems by promoting flexibility and reusability.
       - [Adapter](src/test/java/tests/structural/AdapterTest.java): Transforms between incompatible types using a middle-layer class that translates one type into another.
       - [Bridge](src/test/java/tests/structural/BridgeTest.java): Separates abstraction from implementation, enabling independent development of both.
       - [Composite](src/test/java/tests/structural/CompositeTest.java): Creates tree structures of objects, allowing uniform handling of both individual objects and compositions.
       - [Decorator](src/test/java/tests/structural/DecoratorTest.java): Wraps an object to add new functionality at runtime without modifying its structure.
       - [Facade](src/test/java/tests/structural/FacadeTest.java): Simplifies access to complex subsystems through a unified interface, enhancing readability.
       - [Flyweight](src/test/java/tests/structural/FlyweightTest.java): Minimizes memory usage by sharing a common state between multiple objects instead of duplicating data.
3. **BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS** 
   - concentrate on communication between objects, defining clear interaction protocols. They encapsulate common interaction
     patterns, making it easier to manage and modify object collaborations.
       - [Chain of Responsibility](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/ResponsibilityChainTest.java): Passes requests through a chain of handlers, each deciding to process or pass to the next
         handler.
       - [Command](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/CommandTest.java): Converts method calls into objects, allowing them to be passed as arguments or switched at runtime.
       - [Mediator](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/MediatorTest.java): Centralizes communication between components, reducing direct connections and dependencies.
       - [Memento](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/MementoTest.java): Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
       - [Observer](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/ObserverTest.java): Notifies subscriber objects automatically when a publisher object's state changes.
       - [State](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/StateTest.java): Changes object behavior when its state changes by delegating state-specific behavior to separate classes.
       - [Strategy](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/StrategyTest.java): Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms that can be switched at runtime.
       - [Template](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/TemplateTest.java): Defines an algorithm skeleton, letting subclasses override specific steps while keeping the structure intact.
       - [Visitor](src/test/java/tests/behavioural/VisitorTest.java): Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on, allowing new operations without changing the objects.

## Best Practices

Remember, design patterns are tools, not rules. Use them when they provide clear benefits to your code's structure, maintainability, and flexibility.

1. **Understand the problem first**: Don't force a design pattern where it does not fit
2. **Keep it simple**: Use the simplest pattern that solves your problem
3. **Combine patterns**: Real-world solutions often involve multiple patterns working together
4. **Document your patterns**: Make it clear which patterns you're using and why
5. **Consider trade-offs**: Every pattern has advantages and disadvantages

### Design Pattern Relationships
- **Decorator vs. Composite**: Both involve object composition, but Decorator adds responsibilities to individual objects, while Composite treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Factory vs. Builder**: Factory creates objects in a single step, while Builder constructs objects step by step.
- **Adapter vs. Bridge**: Adapter makes incompatible interfaces work together, while Bridge separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Strategy vs. State**: Strategy allows algorithms to be selected at runtime, while State allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
